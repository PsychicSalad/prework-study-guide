        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visibile content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Elements are the parts of the HTML document which help the web browser understand how to display the contents.</li>
          <li>Tags and elements are slightly different, but often used interchangably, even if this is technically incorrect.</li>
          <li>Header tags are listed as h1, h2, h3 etc. and h1 is the largest size while h6 is the smallest. </li>
          <li>The src attribute is important because it defines the location of the image.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is mostly concerned with the aesthetic and layout of a website.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>There are three main ways to style using CSS, inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheet is most commonly used as it allows for more flexibility with making changes because it uses an external separate file.</li>
          <li>When working with External CSS style sheets you must link it to the HTML file by using the link element.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself Code (or DRY) is encouraged as it allows the code to be more easily fixed and read between different developers.</li>
          <li>margin relates to the amount of space that goes on the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>padding relates to the amount of space that goes around the content that is inside an element.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>Git commands always start with git</li>
          <li>Using a git pull is a good way to ensure you have the latest version of your code.</li>
          <li>git push origin allows you to create a new branch or add changes to a branch.</li>
          <li>It is very important to make sure you are working in the correct branch, which is usually not the main branch.</li>
