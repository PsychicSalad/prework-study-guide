# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for students who are attempting to complete the prework part of the bootcamp. The study guide is designed to be a resource that can help keep notes on the different subjects covered in the prework such as CSS, HTML, Git and Javascript and allows the student to display the notes in a concise, easy to read digital format and help to overcome the problem of information overload. The project aided my understanding of these languages and putting these new coding skills into practice, as well as providing a valuable resource to look back on. I also learnt how to interact with the terminal and input commands in GitBash.
